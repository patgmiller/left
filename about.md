I currently live in Utah and was born in California. I am happily married to my wife Raylene. We were married on Friday January, 24 2003 in the [Oakland, California Temple](https://www.lds.org/temples/details/oakland-california-temple){:target="_blank"} of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

We have two rather exuberant and imaginative children Zachariah, and Olivia. Raylene and I pretty much jumped into parenthood with them and although after bringing them home I coined this phrase for my parenting motto:

> Halfhearted compliance is better than wholehearted defiance!

We are all still alive and each day is a new adventure. I must admit I once had parenting theories that I thought were sound and well grounded ... I no longer have any theories. :smirk:
